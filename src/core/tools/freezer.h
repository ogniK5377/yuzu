/**
 * This class allows the user to prevent an application from writing new values to certain memory
 * locations. This has a variety of uses when attempting to reverse a game.
 *
 * One example could be a cheat to prevent Mario from taking damage in SMO. One could freeze the
 * memory address that the game uses to store Mario's health so when he takes damage (and the game
 * tries to write the new health value to memory), the value won't change.
